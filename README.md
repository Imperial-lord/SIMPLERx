# SimpleRx
### Forget your papers. 📝
What if we told you that you don't need your prescriptions when you go to the doctor's? 👩‍⚕️

What if we told you your pharmacist just needs one ID card to give you all your medicines? 💊

Here's SimpleRx. ✨ All the simplicity, none of the work. 😌

## Installation
### Building dependencies

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:MLH-Fellowship/SIMPLERx.git
$ cd SIMPLERx
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ npm install
```
### Running the server
To run the backend, then you use:
```bash
$ cd app
$ python3 manage.py runserver
	Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```
Finally, using `tmux` or something similar (you can use a shell script as well) to run the frontend:
```bash
$ npm start
```

You should be good to go! 🚀
